# FaceDancer 2.9

this fork is an adaptation of facedancer tool to be used with GreatFET One board.
it is mainly adapted to be used with numap to do USB class scan.
Refer to the adapted numap tool : https://github.com/rsaf010/nu-map

------------

This repository houses the next generation of FaceDancer software. Descended from
the original GoodFET-based FaceDancer, this repository provides a python module 
that provides expanded FaceDancer support-- including support for multiple boards 
and some pretty significant new features.

## Where are my scripts?

In preparation for the 3.0 release of FaceDancer, scripts in the "old" style have
been moved to `legacy-applets`. Their functionality should be unchanged.

These will continue working even after the 3.0 merge; as `facedancer.compat` will
continue to support the old scripts and their syntax.

## What is a FaceDancer?

FaceDancer boards are simple hardware devices that act as "remote-controlled" USB
controllers. With the proper software, you can use these boards to quickly and
easily emulate USB devices-- and to fuzz USB host controllers!

This particular software repository currently allows you to easily create emulations
of USB devices in Python. Control is fine-grained enough that you can cause all
kinds of USB misbehaviors. :)

For more information, see:

 * [Travis Goodspeed's blog post on FaceDancer](http://travisgoodspeed.blogspot.com/2012/07/emulating-usb-devices-with-python.html)
 * [The FaceDancer 21, the original supported board](http://goodfet.sourceforge.net/hardware/facedancer21/)

## USBProxy 'Nouveau' and Protocol Analysis

A major new feature of the newer FaceDancer codebase is the ability to man-in-the
middle USB connections-- replacing one of the authors' original [USBProxy](https://github.com/dominicgs/usbproxy)
project. This opens up a whole new realm of applications-- including protocol analysis
and live manipulation of USB packets-- and is especially useful when you don't control
the software running on the target device (e.g. on embedded systems or games consoles).

This feature is complete, but could use more documentation. Pull requests are welcome. :)


## How do I use this repository?

First, you'll likely want to set the ```BACKEND``` environment variable, which lets
the software know which type of FaceDancer board you'd like to use. If this variable
isn't set, the software will try to guess for you based on what's connected. It doesn't
always make the best guesses, so you're probably better off setting it yourself.

Next, you'll probably want to check out one of the examples, or one of the pre-made scripts.
Examples in the new syntax are located under `examples`. The core FaceDancer scripts in the
"old" syntax are located in `legacy-applets`. 

For example:

```sh
export BACKEND=greatfet
./examples/rubber-ducky.py
```

## What boards are currently supported?

 * All GoodFET-based FaceDancers, including the common FaceDancer21 (```BACKEND=goodfet```)
 * The [GreatFET One](http://greatscottgadgets.com/greatfet/) (```BACKEND=greatfet```)
 * The NXP LPC4330 Xplorer board. (```BACKEND=greatfet```)
 * The CCCamp 2015 rad1o badge with GreatFET l0adable (```BACKEND=greatfet```)
 * RPi + Max3241 Raspdancer boards (```BACKEND=raspdancer```)

Note that hardware restrictions prevent the MAX3420/MAX3421 boards from emulating
more complex devices-- there's limitation on the number/type of endpoints that can be
set up. The LPC4330 boards-- such as the GreatFET-- have fewer limitations.

For a similar reason, the MAX3420/MAX3421 boards (`BACKEND=goodfet` or `BACKEND=raspdancer`)
currently cannot be used as USBProxy-nv MITM devices. All modern boards (`BACKEND=greatfet`)
should be fully functional.

## What boards could be supported soon?

 * The [LUNA USB multitool](https://github.com/greatscottgadgets/luna).
 * Any Linux computer with gadgetfs support (e.g. the Pi Zero or Beaglebone Black)
 * Anything supporting USB-over-IP.

## What features do you plan on adding?

The roadmap is hazy, but in addition to multi-board support, this repository
eventually will be home to some cool new features, such as:

 * High-speed ("USB 2.0") device emulation on devices with USB 2.0 PHYs.
 * On-the-fly

## Whose fault _is_ this?

There are a lot of people to blame for the awesomeness that is this repo,
including:

 * Kate Temkin (@ktemkin)
 * Travis Goodspeed (@travisgoodspeed)
 * Sergey Bratus (@sergeybratus)
 * Dominic Spill (@dominicgs)
 * Michael Ossmann (@michaelossmann)
 * Mikaela Szekely (@Qyriad)
 * anyone whose name appears in the git history :)
